# SalarySheet
Add-on for Google Spreadsheets
## Install & Usage Steps ##
1. Open a spreadsheet
2. Go to Tools > Script Editor
3. Go to the tab it opened
4. Name the app whatever you want (I'm using the name "SalarySheet")
5. Replace the contents of the "Code.gs" file in the editor with the "Code.gs" file in this repository
6. Go to File > New > Html file
7. Name the file "sidebar" (Don't give it the .html tag, it'll be added by the editor)
8. Replace the contents of the "sidebar.html" file in the editor with the "sidebar.html" file in this repository
9. Save all
10. Go back to the Spreadsheet and refresh it (This will close the Script Editor, but you don't need it open anymore)
11. Go to Add-ons > SalarySheet (Or whatever you named the app) > Show Sidebar
12. Click the link at the top of the sidebar
13. In the new tab, use your human intution to figure out that app
14. Go back to your Spreadsheet and in the sidebar put in the data from the other tab (The following is to help you decide what goes where, the format is: Data on calculator -> Location on sidebar):
a. Hours -> Regular Hours Worked
b. Gross Paycheck -> Gross Pay
c. Net Paycheck -> Net Pay
d. Pay Period -> Pay Period
15. Now click "Start" and the table should be formulated
